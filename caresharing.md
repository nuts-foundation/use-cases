## cBoards - Nedap ONS (usecase: consent)

cBoards is the Trello for multidisciplinary collaboration in healthcare. It is used by many different types of healthcare providers; care, cure, informal care givers and for the patient itself. cBoards can be integrated with other IT systems or can be used as a stand alone application. In the Netherlands providers like home nurses, pharmacists and general practitioners use cBoards to work together, in so called ‘boards', on specific themes like elderly care, palliative care, self management regarding chronic diseases, and other types of multidisciplinary collaborations. cBoards is not necessarily the primary registration system of the participants of a board. Therefore, users should be able to register data in their primary system, that can then (partially) be shared with the participants in cBoards and vica versa. 

Nedap ONS and cBoards are both used in different regions in The Netherlands by respectively the home nurse and the general practitioner. There are many examples in which the general practitioner likes to keep the home nurses up to date and the other way around. They like to be able to share observations, measurements, contacts and messaging.

To make above scenarios possible, the following steps should be developed:
Authentication, which is already covered in Nuts via the so called Irma app. 
Decentralised consent records
Sharing of observations, measurements, contacts and messaging. 

Specifically for this use case the focus will be on ‘decentralised consent records’. This step can also be used to start with logging, logging makes it possible for users (patient) to see exactly what happened concerning consent, sharing of data, etc (who did what and when?).
